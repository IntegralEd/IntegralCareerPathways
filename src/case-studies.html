          <li>Personalized advising pathways aligned to student postsecondary goals</li>
          <li>Professional learning modules for counselors and mentors on postsecondary transitions</li>
          <li>Integration with existing school systems and mentoring organization workflows</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Outcomes</h3>
        <ul class="service-list">
          <li>Increased percentage of students completing college applications and FAFSA submissions</li>
          <li>Counselors reported higher confidence supporting students through postsecondary planning</li>

Students needed exposure to career opportunities, hands-on learning experiences, and connections to employer partners.</p>

        <h3>What We Built</h3>

        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>KIPP Forward needed to shift their counselor training model from centralized in-person delivery to a scalable, regionally-led approach. The goal was to build internal capacity for professional learning while maintaining quality and alignment across a growing network.</p>

        <h3>What We Built</h3>

          <li>Annual train-the-trainer modules now delivered in each region with consistent quality</li>
          <li>Counselors reported sustained engagement with training content and resources</li>
          <li>Regional teams developed ownership and capacity to iterate training based on local needs</li>
